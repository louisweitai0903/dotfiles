# Project Documentation Standards

Documentation is mandatory for every project.

Required structure:

```text
project-root/
│
├── HANDOFF.md
├── README.md
├── STATUS.md
├── PROGRESS.md
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── folder-structure.md
│   ├── setup.md
│   └── ...
```

## README.md

README.md must always be maintained and updated.

It should contain:

- Project overview
- Purpose and goals
- Features
- Technology stack
- Installation instructions
- Environment setup
- Configuration requirements
- Running the application
- Testing instructions
- Deployment instructions
- Known limitations
- Future improvements

Whenever functionality changes, verify whether the README requires updates.

## STATUS.md

STATUS.md represents the current state of the project.

Include:

- Current version
- Project health
- Completed features
- Features in progress
- Known issues
- Technical debt
- Blockers
- Upcoming milestones

Update STATUS.md whenever a task changes the project state.

## PROGRESS.md

PROGRESS.md acts as a development journal.

Every completed task should record:

- Date
- Task description
- Files modified
- Summary of implementation
- Validation performed
- Remaining concerns

This file should provide a clear history of development work.

## HANDOFF.md

HANDOFF.md is the continuity document for future sessions. It should help the next agent quickly understand the current project state without re-discovering completed work.

Include:

- Failed attempts, including what was tried and why it did not work.
- A concise summary of STATUS.md, focused on current project health, blockers, and active work.
- A concise summary of PROGRESS.md, focused on the latest completed tasks and validation performed.
- Changes made during the current session, especially core functions, architecture, data flows, commands, and important files modified.
- Clear next steps, including recommended commands, tests, open questions, and risks.

## docs/

Every project must contain a docs folder.

Documentation should cover:

- Architecture
- Folder structure
- Design decisions
- Database schema
- API documentation
- Authentication flow
- Deployment procedures
- Development workflow
- Third-party integrations

## Folder Documentation

Important folders should have documentation describing:

- Purpose
- Responsibilities
- Key files
- Dependencies
- Usage patterns

A new developer should be able to understand the structure of the project by reading the documentation.

## Documentation Maintenance

Documentation is part of the implementation.

Whenever code changes:

1. Review README.md.
2. Review STATUS.md.
3. Review PROGRESS.md.
4. Review HANDOFF.md.
5. Review docs/.
6. Update any outdated documentation.

A task is not complete until documentation is updated.
